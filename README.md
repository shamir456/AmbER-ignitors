# AmbER-ignitors

## Inspiration
To this day, there remains no constructive, operative, and practical method that efficiently helps in emergencies to deliver time-critical patients to hospitals.

The access to ambulances and the reaching of ambulances on the location of patients have been time-consuming. Not only that but, also the process to register an ambulance can take approximately 10 to 20 minutes for a person. This happens because the user has to explain the route to the ambulance driver, providing details to the ambulance call center. These formalities take a lot of time, which can be fatal for critical patients reaching the hospital on time.

## What it does

AmbER (Ambulance to ER ) acting exactly as its name suggests when it comes to registering an ambulance and making contact easier between ambulance service and the user. Where the whole process is automated, you don't have to worry about any external equipment as it is just available on your mobile phones. All you have to do is a message in WhatsApp, provide the address using pin location and hospital name you need to go, provide other necessary information for ambulance service and you won't feel troubled about getting an ambulance to your doorstep. From there The ambulance captains have access to the AmbER app through which they will reach you through the most optimal route, but also will help them in utilizing the best route from the pickup to the hospital making sure that critical emergencies can be catered in the most optimized time.  It is time-efficient, easy, and reliable.



## Innovation
Currently, no such automated system exists which provides such service. Also, the integration of whatsapp and google maps with ambulance captain app in flutter can allow ambulances to reach user in least amount of time and also be aware of any extra conditions that may be needed for Pre-hospital care. Also after reaching the pickup point the ambulance captain can have access to multiple routes to reach hospital using our app which is integrated with Google Maps allowing them to be alerts open/closed roads, and road with high traffic.



## Challenges I ran into

## Impact 
In Pakistan, the ambulance service systems are quite unreliable. The number of hospitals in Pakistan is limited. Also, the process of calling an ambulance and registering and contacting the ambulance driver to help him to reach the location takes up a considerable amount of time. Using our solution we tend to reduce that time as much as possible and provide the ambulance captain's as much knowledge and information before reaching the pickup point to assist the user in this emergency and help in saving a person's life.


## What's next for AmbER
To make it more accessible for less privilidges population, AmbER needs to be integrated with SMS service using twilio and allowing them access to this amazing service helping people save lifes.
